"""
Domain Services Package.

This package contains service classes that implement the core business logic of the
Chat Service. These services are responsible for managing conversations, processing
messages, classifying intents, and building conversation context for AI models.

Services in this package follow the domain-driven design principle of encapsulating
business logic in service classes that operate on domain models. Each service has a
specific responsibility and collaborates with other services and repositories to
fulfill business requirements.
