"""
Domain models package for the Adaptor Service.

This package contains the core domain entities that encapsulate the business rules
and data structures central to the application. These models represent the fundamental
concepts within the system and contain the critical business logic.

Domain models are persistence-agnostic and focus only on the business domain.
