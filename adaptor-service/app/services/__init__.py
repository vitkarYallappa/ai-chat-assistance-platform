"""
Services package for the Adaptor Service.

This package contains service classes that orchestrate application workflows,
coordinating between domain models, repositories, and external adapters. 
Services encapsulate the primary business operations and use cases of the application.

Services depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations, following
the dependency inversion principle.
